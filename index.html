        <p>
          Bilal ibn Rabah (580-640 CE) was an Abyssinian slave who became one of the most prominent companions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). He is well-known for his unwavering faith, resilience, and his role as the first Mu'adhdhin (caller to prayer) in Islam.

        <p>
          Bilal's devotion to Islam and his beautiful voice made him the perfect choice for the important task of calling the believers to prayer. He faced immense persecution and torture from the disbelievers of Makkah but remained steadfast in his faith. His famous cry of "Ahad! Ahad!" (One! One!) echoed the monotheistic message of Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the conquest of Makkah, Bilal was appointed as the Mu'adhdhin by the Prophet Muhammad himself. He continued to serve the Muslim community and played a significant role in the spreading of Islam. Bilal's life serves as an inspiration for Muslims to stand firm in their beliefs and overcome adversity.
